# RAD List 
RAD List is a full stack web application that helps users discover new artists. It was inspired by my love of music and wanting to make a tool that would make finding new artists easier. RAD List generates a playlist full of tracks, based on the artist a user provides. This way, you can find new artists based on ones you already like. It also allows the user save and store playlists to their account for later recall and view a profile with user details including saved playlists.

## About the Developer
Prior to Hackbright, Alex ran a practice as an acupuncturist, working with patients and coming up with creative ways to make their lives easier. Before that, she studied chemistry because she loves science and learning how to reason and solve problems. Her programming journey began 3 years ago when she was diagnosed with cancer and had to stop working. During that time, she began taking coding courses from Code Academy and she was totally hooked! She loves puzzles and the problem-solving aspect of coding. She found that she got the same joy from solving a coding problem that she did from resolving a tricky patient case. Once she was better, she took the plunge, signed up for the program and couldnâ€™t be happier. When she is not coding, she likes movies, music and playing games.
